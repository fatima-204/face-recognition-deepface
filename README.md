# Face Recognition using DeepFace

This repository contains a face recognition project built using the **DeepFace** library. It detects and recognizes faces in images or videos, leveraging pre-trained deep learning models for high accuracy and performance.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Detects faces in images or videos.
- **Face Recognition**: Recognizes faces using pre-trained models.
- **DeepFace Library**: Utilizes the DeepFace library for easy and accurate face recognition.
- **Easy to Use**: Includes scripts for detection and recognition.
